## 2021_CSE2010_12484

Course repo for Hanyang-CSE2010 (Data Structures) \
Taken in Spring of 2021 at HYU \
Instructor: Prof. PARK, JONG-IL (https://mr.hanyang.ac.kr/ jipark@hanyang.ac.kr)

* **Course outline**
  * **Description**: 
    This course introduces various data structures, such as linked list, stack, queue, heap, binary search tree, balanced trees, and graph, which can organize data of various time and space complexity. Abstract data types will also be covered, including operations of searching, inserting, and deleting elements in each data structure. The main goal of this course is to learn how to design and select efficient data structures and operations. Students will learn how to compare data structures in terms of time and space complexity. In addition, students will have opportunities to learn how these data structures can be applied for solving computational problems. In the accompanying laboratory sessions, students will also have hands-on experience to implement data structures using the C programming language.
